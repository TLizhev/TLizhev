Hi, my name is Todor.

I have completed the C# course at SoftUni and I'm currently working as a Software Engineer.

I've mosly worked with C# and SQL making apps using ASP.NET Core, but I have been learning a bit of HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the side.

If you have any tips or a job opportunity I'd gladly hear you out.

You can reach me at tlijev@gmail.com
